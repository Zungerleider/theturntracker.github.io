        Welcome to my website! Sorry for the mess- we're currently under construction. <br>
        <br>
        Hopefully, this site will eventually contain the wiki for my world, &#60worldnamehere&#62. In the meantime, it's going to serve as a playground where I'm going to learn css and HTML! (You can tell I don't know much code yet, but that should change soon.)
    </p>
    <p>
        My current goals include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create lists!</li>
        <li>Incoperate basic CSS (colors, sizes, alignments)</li>
        <li>Figure out a way to organize &#60stuff&#62 clearly.</li>
        <li>Figure out how to code the that ^^^ .</li>
        <li>Add more stuff to this list!</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Want to see a second page? <a href="./Page2.html">Click here!</a> <br>
        I'm not sure if I'm going to use pages, or in-page scripts, or something? We'll see.
