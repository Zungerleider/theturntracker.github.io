            Welcome to my website!
            <br>
            Sorry for the mess- we're currently under construction.
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Hopefully, this site will eventually contain the  wiki for my world, &#60worldnamehere&#62.
            <br>
            In the meantime, it's serving as a playground where I'm going to learn css and HTML! (You can tell that I don't know much code yet, but that should change soon.)
        </h2>
        <p>
            My current goals include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Create to-do list</li>
            <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Incoperate basic CSS (colors, sizes, alignments)</li>
            <li>Mess around with animation/transitions (css? javascript? idk yet)</li>
            <li>Figure out a way to organize &#60stuff&#62 clearly.</li>
            <li>Figure out how to code the that ^^^ .</li>
            <li>Do stuff with Bootstrap, whatever that is.</li>
            <li>Add more things to this list!</li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            Want to see a second page? <a href="./Page2.html">Click here!</a>
            <br>
            I'm not sure if I'm going to use pages, or in-page scripts, or something? We'll see.
